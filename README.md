SQL Challenge - Module 9

Within the EmployeeSQL folder, please find the employee schema, the relationship diagram, and the queries relevant to Module 9. The relationship diagram indicates the relationships/ modeling between tables, while the schema illustrates the data engineering of the tables leveraged for this project. The SQL queries themselves give us the analysis to all of our project questions.

Thank you!
Taylor
